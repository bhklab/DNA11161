1. [BEN] Compute pairwise correlation between Affy and illumina RNA-seq by
 
(i) Selecting the best Affy probesets using jetset;
(ii) Selecting the most correlated probesets;
(iii) Use the isoform expression FPKMs and compare then with the most similar probesets
 
    *   Test whether selecting the most correlated probeset per gene or the most correlated pair (probeset, transcript) is dramatically improving the correlation distribution
    *   Plot, for each patient, the expression values as measured by Affy and RNA-Seq; this will help showing that the dynamic range of RNAseq is better than the one of microarray for low expression genes
 
 2. [BEN] For the Affy signatures, use the probesets or the RNA-seq data and compute signature scores and classification, and compare them;
 
 3. [BEN] For the non-affy signatures, compute the score and classification using either the jetset or the most correlated probeset
 
    *   Add the DCN, STROMA CD10, TOP2 INDEX to the pool of signatures;
 
 4. [NORMAN] Compute and plot correlation between signature scores; try to use the "MEAS" plot (see papers in attachment) ;
 
 5. [NORMAN] Check whether large gene signatures are always more correlated, do a random selection of genes of increasing size;
 
 6. [BEN] From the correlation distribution, classify the well and poorly correlated genes;
 
 
7. [TEAM WORK] Find the reasons why some gene are poorly correlated. Start with some genes of interest (ESR1, ERBB2, PLAU, STAT1)
    *   level of expression [BEN]
    *   alternative splicing, using bioMart or the website Christine mentioned [DEBORA]
http://www.as3d.org/human2006/
 
    *   Mappability [VINCENT, ?]
    *   association with gene lengths using the genomcfeatures package [NORMAN]
 
 8.  Write the paper
 
 9.  Optional analyses: association of gene and isoform FPKMs with subtypes and survival -> not enough data
 
 10. Retrieve and analyze TCGA data
